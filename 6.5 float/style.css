    /*- Works when items wrap into multiple rows. Controls spacing between rows.
- flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch.*/
}

/* These control how individual items behave inside the container.
- flex-grow
Defines how much an item can grow relative to others.
Example: flex-grow: 1; → item expands to fill available space.
- flex-shrink
Defines how much an item can shrink when space is tight.
Example: flex-shrink: 0; → item won’t shrink.
- flex-basis
Sets the starting size of the item before grow/shrink.
Example: flex-basis: 200px; → item starts at 200px width.
- flex (shorthand)
Combines grow, shrink, and basis.
Example: flex: 1 0 150px; → grow=1, shrink=0, basis=150px.
- align-self
Overrides align-items for a single item.
Example: align-self: center; → only that item is centered vertically.
